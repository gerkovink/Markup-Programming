I am not always in the office. Luckily, G+ Hangouts allows us to talk to one another as if we were in the same room. If you need me, use the methods described below to contact me. You can contact me for anything related to this course. I will respond as quickly as possible to your inquiries.

#### Contacting me through e-mail

You can always e-mail me through my Utrecht University e-mail address: G.Vink@uu.nl. I would prefer it if you did not use my G+ Hangouts address `askgerko@gmail.com for e-mail.
