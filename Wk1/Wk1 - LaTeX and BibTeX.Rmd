# About us

# About the course

## Format
- Every Monday till the end of the year:
  
    - 10 am - 12.45 pm
    - Ruppert 005 & Ruppert 121
    - The first part of every meeting will be a lecture. 
    - Every second part will be hands-on / Q&A

If you cannot make a meeting; I'd like to know beforehand. 

### **I'd strongly suggest to participate in every meeting**

## Topics

1. Intro to $\LaTeX$ and ${Bib}\TeX$
2. Beamer-presentations and equations
3. Tables and Figures
4. Reproducible workflows with rMarkdown
5. Version control and GitHub repositories
6. Presentations with rMarkdown
7. GitHub pages and Shiny
8. $\star$ *Showcase your progress*

$\star$ *In week 8 you have to showcase what you have mastered in this course.*

## Exercises
To develop the necessary skills for completing this course, 7 exercises (weeks 1-7) must be made and submitted:

- These exercises are not graded, but students must fulfil them to pass the course. 
- Exercises have to be handed in **before** the next meeting.
- Answers will be posted after the next meeting.

## Grading {.smaller}
The final grade is computed as follows:

| Topic | % of Total   |
|-----+-------|
| Markup manuscript  | 30% |
| Research repository   | 30%  |
| Personal repository   | 10%  |
| Shiny app             | 15%  |
| Visual presentation   | 15%  |

### Good to know
Grading considers concepts like visual appearance, readability, usefulness, efficiency of the code. *Grading does not consider the theoretical or qualitative properties of the content*!
  
## Contact
If you need any help outside of class hours, see [this link](Contacting_Gerko.html)

- send me an e-mail at G.Vink@uu.nl' containing your question or a [MWE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example):

    - if your problem is with $\LaTeX$, please send me your '.tex' and (if relevant)
    '.bib' file. 
    - if your problem is with 'R', send me the code and source files
    
- Whatsapp: If you're really in a pickle and need a blazingly fast response

- G+ Hangouts: If the problem warrants videa and screen sharing, I'll invite you to a G+ hangout
    

## Goal of this course {.smaller}

***Learn the skills and tools to present yourself and your work.***

**Useful for**: a phd, career in data science, being at the state-of-the-art in markup programming. 

**What to do** (not in any definitive order)

1. Perform a (monte carlo) simulation study
2. Create a scientific manuscript 
3. Program your simulation such that it creates a data archive
4. Publish this archive to GitHub
5. Tell people about yourself on GitHub
6. Showcase your findings through a shiny web-app
7. Create a presentation about your simulations

## Before next meeting

1. Choose a subject for your project
2. Install TeX, an editor and a bibliography editor
3. Request a [GitHub educational discounted account](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack/)
4. Make exercise 1 and 2

# $\LaTeX$

## LaTeX

LaTeX is a document preparation system

- its goal is typesetting
- it produces high quality type-set documents
- publishers use it
- you can virtually produce anything in document form with LaTeX
- it provides you with a system to focus solely on writing

    - you do not have to worry about the layout, etc. LaTeX does. 
    
## An example

I'll demonstrate to you a typical LaTeX document. 

If you could not make it to class, and you feel the exercises are not sufficient for getting you started; please ask me: I'll be happy to show you in real life or through G+ Hangouts.
