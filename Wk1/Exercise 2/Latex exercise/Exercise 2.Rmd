Dear all, 

In this exercise we will learn how to use $\LaTeX$ to reference our citations and sections. Later on, we will also learn how to refer to Figures and Tables. 

Let's start.

# Referencing in `Tex`
There are two general (read: widely used) ways of referencing in `Tex`:

1. The standard citation environment in Tex
2. The [`natbib`](http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php?lang=en) citation environment

The difference between the two implementations is in the level of customization. The standard citation environment is simple, but limited. `natbib` allows you to customize pretty much anything. The good thing is that both implementations use the same front- and backend; only the calls differ:

- to cite a publication in `tex`, use `\cite{}` to produce a `(Author, year)` reference, and use `\citeA{}` to produce a `Author (year)` reference (at least in APA style). 
- in `natbib`, `\citep{}` produces the `(Author, year)` reference and `\citet{}` yields the `Author (year)` reference (when using APA style)

So, why use `natbib` instead of the standard citation environment? First, `natbib` works with the `hyperref` package, which you should always use (see week 1). Second, depending on the target journal for any research project, style conventions for referencing may differ. For example, in medicinal sciences the convention is to use numbered references (such as [1], [2] and [3-5]). In psychology, people adhere to the APA rules and references are adressed in so-called author-year style. `natbib` allows you to very quickly specify these styles, without any hassle. The standard citation environment does not fully allow for such implementations. Third, many journals use `natbib` themselves. So if you acquire the style files from the journal, you do not have to change all the `\cite{}`'s and `\citeA{}`'s.

# BibTex
BibTeX is reference management software for formatting lists of references. Bluntly stolen from wikipedia: 

---

Hereâ€™s how BibTeX works. It takes as input

a. an `.aux` file produced by LaTeX on an earlier run;
b. a `.bst` file (the style file), which specifies the general reference-list style and specifies how to format individual entries, and which is written by a style designer [..] in a special-purpose language [..], and
c. `.bib` file(s) constituting a database of all reference-list entries the user might ever hope to use.
      
BibTeX chooses from the `.bib` file(s) only those entries specified by the `.aux` file (that is, those given by LaTeX's \cite or \nocite commands), and creates as output a `.bbl` file containing these entries together with the formatting commands specified by the `.bst` file. LaTeX will use the `.bbl` file, perhaps edited by the user, to produce the reference list.

---

In other words; you have a global bibliography (library) - or a seperate bibliography for each project, if you wish -  with all your references. This is your `.bib` file. When you run `tex`, an `.aux` file is produced. If you reference to something in your text, these citations will be recorded in the `.aux` file. `bibtex` will match the citations in your `.aux` file to those in the specified `.bib` file (and produce an error if you reference somthing that is not in your `.bib` file) to produce a `.bbl` file that specifically matches the bibliography style (e.g. numbers, APA style, sorted, alphabetized, etc.) that you have specified in `tex`. If you re-run your `tex` code now, the references will be printed in your pdf. 

Have a look at the manuscript in the `\Latex background` folder in this week's course page folder for an example of a `natbib` implementation. Especially take a look at the `.bib` and `.bbl` files. See e.g. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) for a list of all possible citation elements you can refer to with `bibtex`. 

## Re-running `tex` after `bibtex`
This is important. In fact, it is so important (and a common error by students and experts) that I devote a seperate paragraph to it! `bibtex` and `tex` are NOT the same and their code has not by default run simultaneously --> you need the following order:

1. compile (or set) your `tex` code
2. compile your `bibtex` environment
3. re-compile your `tex` code to include the stuff `bibtex` produced
3. re-compile your `tex` code to process and print the `tex` vs `bibtex` implementation

Depending on the software you use to write in `tex`, you can automate this procedure to always include `bibtex` when compiling your `tex` code. I choose not too, but that is my personal preference (running redundant commands every time is just a waste of time and resources, even when it is fast). But 'whatever floats your boat'.

# Reference managers
There is a lot of specialized software to manage your bibliographies. Such software would allow you to import `bibtex` entries from search engines such as Google Scholar and assign your own reference key to each publication. You need a good reference manager if you work with `bibtex`. If you are on Windows/Linux, I would suggest [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/). If you are on a Mac, the [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) reference manager that is included in the MacTex distribution would be perfect. These are suggestions. There are many more reference managers. Again; whatever floats your boat. 

So let's start the exercises.

# Exercise

If you missed it earlier; [here](http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php?lang=en) you can find a very useful `natbib` reference sheet. For all exercises, use the `exercises.bib` bibliography and the `bib_template.tex` file from the course page. Specify the references such that you obtain the desired output. 

---

1. Have a look at [this page](https://nl.sharelatex.com/learn/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX) and [this page](https://nl.sharelatex.com/learn/Bibliography_management_with_natbib) for even more detail on `natbib` and `bibtex`. 
2. See how in the `bib_template.tex` file the first line of Section 2 refers back to Section 1 through `\ref{label}`.
3. Study the examples in the `Latex background/Examples` folder. Especially study the example `Example4_natbib numbered.tex` as it provides you with a way of enclosing your bibliography in your `tex` file. Some journals require this. 

Create five documents:

4. Produce a document named `Ex2V0.pdf` based on `bib_template.tex` with numbered references that are sorted alphabetically, but not compressed
5. Produce a document named `Ex2V1.pdf` with numbered references that are sorted on order of appearance, but not compressed.
5. Produce a document named `Ex2V2.pdf` with numbered references that are sorted on order of appearance and compressed.
6. Produce a document named `Ex2V3.pdf` document in APA style. Make sure that reference URL's are printed in the References Section. 
7. Produce a document named `Ex2V4.pdf` document in APA style, with references highlighted in black. 

Upload the documents to [SurfDrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/tiBnPyIZy8B9w73) before the next lecture starts. I will post the code solutions after that lecture.
