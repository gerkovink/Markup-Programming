Dear all, 

This week we will learn how to use $\LaTeX$ to create tables and how to print 
figures. As a matter of fact, we are using R to gives us figures and tables 
that we can directly implement in $\LaTeX$. 

Let's start.

This week there is a chain of documents that tell
you how to approach tables and figures in $\LaTeX$ when using `R`. These documents can serve as a reference for you to pick the table and/or figure you need for the project at hand. At the end you are asked to recreate a page in $\LaTeX$. 

You have come a long way in programming $\LaTeX$ and I am certain that by now you have the 
skills to approach this independently, but with the help from some walkthroughs and 
examples. Take a look at the `LaTeX background.zip` file on the course page and read the documents in the archive in the presented order.

So far the very brief intro. Have fun!

# Exercise
1. Study the figure documents in the `LaTeX background.zip` file.

  - The `0. GraphsFromRtoLaTeX.R` file explains how to export graphs to lossless formats that `tex` can fully utilize. 
  - The `1. ExampleFigure.tex` document demonstrates implementation of figures in `tex`

2. Study the table documents in the ``LaTeX background.zip` file.

  - The `0. Mori_Tables in LaTeX.pdf` document is an in-depth guide to tables in `tex`
  - The `1. ExampleTable.tex` and `.pdf` files takes the basics from the `Mori` document to demonstrate some straightforward implementation, resizing, placement and rotation of tables in `tex`
  - The `2. R-tables in LaTeX.R`, `.tex` and `.pdf` files demonstrate how to conveniently export your data table in `R` to `tex` by means of the `R`-package `xtable`
  - The `3. Additional xtable_examples.tex` and `.pdf` files display the code and realization of different tables that are generated with package `xtable`
  
3. Use the following `R`-code
```{r eval=FALSE}
#load package lattice
library(lattice)
library(xtable)
#fix the random generator seed
set.seed(123)
#create data
data <- rnorm(1000)
#plot histogram
histogram(data)
#plot density 
densityplot(data^12 / data^10, xlab = expression(data^12/data^10))
#plot stripplot
stripplot(data^2, xlab = expression(data^2))
#plot boxplot
bwplot(exp(data))
#matrix with all data used
data.all <- cbind(data = data, 
                  squared1 = data^12 / data^10,
                  squared2 = data^2,
                  exponent = exp(data))
```

to generate the graphs that allow you to create the following page in $\LaTeX$. The exercise is to recreate [this page](Answer/Recreate this.pdf) yourself:

</center>

Upload the documents (at least the `.tex` and `.pdf`'s) to DropBox before the next lecture. I will post the solution to the exercise after the next lecture.
