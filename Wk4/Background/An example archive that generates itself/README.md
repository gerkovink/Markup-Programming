Pooling multiple imputations when the sample happens to be the population

---
This repository contains all necessary files to replicate the simulation study for the manuscript "Pooling multiple imputations when the sample happens to be the population" by Gerko Vink and Stef van Buuren. This manuscript can be found at http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.8542v1.pdf. Software requirements are R (http://www.r-project.org}) and R-package mice (version 2.21, http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mice/index.html).
